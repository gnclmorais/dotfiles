# dotfiles

My personal dot files. They are written in [fish shell][0], so you‚Äôll have to adapt certain things if you want to run them. üê†


# Usage

To backup, run `source backup.sh` from the root of the project. Backups will be updated on the folder `backups/`.
To install, run `source install.sh` from the root of the project. This will use the folder `backups/` if there are any present.
